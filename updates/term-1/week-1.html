      <h3 class="article-h3">Defining a Professional Identity</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">During the class in Wednesday, we were asked to define our own skills, knowledge and attitudes. Seen below is a first draft of this overview that came to be in the class. It maps several skills and interests agains a two-axis matrix, defined by both proficiency and passion. Within the plotted points, a further differentiation in categories can be found. The arrows hint at professional development opportunities.</p>

      <h3 class="article-h3">Reflecting on complementary profiles</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">During conversations with classmates it became evident that complementary skills were important in achieving formal success in a future project. But another criteria clearly stood out for me: The crucial matter of not only complementing skills but also complementing personalities. In many conversations, the synergy between working in a more conceptual way versus working in a more spontaneous way played a important role. Since I personally consider myself more a conceptually strong person, I benefit enormously from intuitive, more hands-on project partners at my side, especially in the heat of a project&#x27;s execution. That was one of the most important takeaways for me in the last years – and this week&#x27;s conversations doubled down on this. </p>

      <h3 class="article-h3">Course structure and connected goals</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">An overview of the desired skills, knowledge and attitudes associated with each course module can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wCr6a-c7yWSvyAJcHcYPs_AsMHw75jxupEdT6Wch1Qs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="link">MDEF course structure and connected goals.</a>
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-h3">Draft for a Personal Development Plan</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">To summarize all of the above, including the reflection on the future curriculum and my conversations with classmates, it becomes clear that the next nine months offer a plethora of opportunities for self-improvement. It even offers so many possibilities that one inevitably has to be guided by the personal motivations for studying MDEF, otherwise it will feel both too overwhelming and lacking focus. I prefer to carefully select a few main topics and deeply dive into them in the course of this study. Which topics these are exactly depends of a lot of factors; further I am holding myself back from settling on these main focus points too early in order to avoid excluding some interesting opportunities I might not have seen before. Reflecting after week one of the curriculum, some of these focus points could include: AI, sustainability, fabrication, biomaterials, blockchain and music. <br><br>In terms of sharpening my professional profile, my motivations are not guided by a specific career ambition. I do not aim for a certain job profile after the master degree, instead I&#x27;m hoping this degree allows me to further grow as a design generalist and enables me to work in a more speculative, experimental and multidisciplinary way than before. In that sense, I perceive this study much more as a creative open-ended experimental field than a stringent and fixed professional training. If everything goes well, it will enable me to sharpen my portfolio as a designer, who can actively shape the way we interact with technology in the next centuries. </p>
