      <h3 class="article-h3">The Leading Idea</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">This core idea revolves around our relationship with nature, while being part of it, and how technology could help mend this broken relationship. By default, this relationship is symbiotic. However throughout the course of the last centuries, we managed to turn it into a one-sided, dysfunctional and rather abusive relationship. It could go for like this for many centuries more if it weren&#x27;t for the simple fact that we are not exclusive from the system we&#x27;re tampering with, but we&#x27;re part of it. Guided by the misconception, that we, as humans, did somehow rise from our modest evolutionary origins as animals and ascend to something higher, we are disregarding and exploiting the interlinked ecosystem we stem from and are embedded within. <br><br>But if the reason for this tragedy lies (in the western world) in our culturally-fueled inflated sense of self as a species, is there a chance it can be healed by invoking empathy for others organisms? May the answer be to foster inter-species collaboration in order to perceive other animals or plants as equal kin, rather than subordinates? The answer is complex, however one thing can be said with certainty: We, as humans, have a much harder time empathizing with organisms we cannot communicate with. This has been the major hurdle for understanding and thus, empathizing with all parts of nature and arguably, animals that developed a shared communication protocol, receive more attention and protection (e.g. dogs). <br><br>However, therein lies a massive potential. If organisms are unable to communicate in a shared protocol with us, be it through sound, touch or voice, can technology jump in as a translator? Can a machine learning text-generation network be an advocate for animal rights? Can a chatbot be a representative surrogate for a plant? Can a microcontroller communicate the health status to be the voice for an algae colony? Looking at the experiments conducted in the past quarter, I would argue, yes. Technology has the potential to act as an empathy machine. Thus, I am fascinated by the idea of <em>bewitching</em> or <em>enchanting</em> organisms that traditionally have never had a voice to make them able to speak for themselves, to be perceived as emancipated and equal. In this metaphor, technology acts like a magic wand as it can bring the illusion of intelligence for any species, setting, goal or language we choose. This is a fascinating idea, because, put bluntly, it doesn&#x27;t need much to fool us as humans. We&#x27;re just mere animals after all.</p>
