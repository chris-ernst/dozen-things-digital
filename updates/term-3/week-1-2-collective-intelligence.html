        <p><em><span>This important to contextualize the work of Lorenzo and Akasha team, since they are actively fighting for the community not to repeat the same mistakes with Web3 as with Web2.</span></em></p>

      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p>In fact, when the whole logic of the economy revolves around the needs of capital, it's those very needs that exercise the gravitational pull that turns these numerous seemingly emancipatory decentralized platforms into invisible enforces of the hyper-capitalist project. 3/5</p>— Evgeny Morozov (@evgenymorozov) <a href="https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov/status/1485510319766126597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 24, 2022</a>

      <p><strong><span>On existing implementations. Can Web3 actually distribute trust? Opinions:</span></strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em><span>We should accept the premise that people will not run their own servers by designing systems that can distribute trust without having to distribute infrastructure. This means architecture that anticipates and accepts the inevitable outcome of relatively centralized client/server relationships, but uses cryptography (rather than infrastructure) to distribute trust. One of the surprising things to me about web3, despite being built on “crypto,” is how little cryptography seems to be involved! […] We should try to reduce the burden of building software. At this point, software projects require an enormous amount of human effort. […] I think changing our relationship to technology will probably require making software easier to create, but in my lifetime I’ve seen the opposite come to pass.</span></em><span> Moxie Marlinspike, Signal founder</span></p>

Your social circle is a few dozen people, so you can easily keep track of who’s kind, who’s generous, who cheats, who steals, who shares their food. A repeated game. Webs of trust form organically. You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours. These reputations get shared through gossip, and the result is a high-trust context, where people can cooperate without really thinking about it.</span><br>
            <span>Beyond 150, you start to run into problems. You can’t keep track of all the players, so free-riders get away with it. Sociopathic behaviors become personally advantageous. This isn’t just true for hunter-gatherers. We see it in contemporary communities, too.”</span></em></p>

      </p>
      <p><span>Centralized power was historically needed as a way to ensure collaboration beyond the Dunbar-scale. Vertical hierarchies were necessary to ensure mutual trust. This included banks, judges and police, backed by governments, currencies and, ultimately, military power. Through this, a contract with a stranger could be enforced or persecuted if breached. Supported by a shared framework of narratives around nations, culture, religion and law, this enabled collaboration to scale to the size of empires.</span></p>

Second-gen blockchains add a layer of “conditions” to transactions so that people can agree on terms in smart contracts rather than relying on intermediaries. Third-gen blockchains aim to resolve fundamental flaws including scalability and interoperability which means blockchain can sustain mass adoption and not suffer problems like slow transaction time and closed systems.”</span></p>

While Bitcoin is widely adopted, even by traditional financial institutions, it has severe limitations in scalability and capability. Ethereum is working hard to address both problems with a very active developer community, but is not as widely adopted. 3rd generation protocols, such as Cardano, are aiming strike an optimal balance between security, speed and functionality, but are just ramping up to relevant adoption rates.” (Notes from Chris M)</span></p>

        <p><span>“With conventional contracts, a document outlines the terms of a relationship between two parties, which is enforceable by law. If one Party A violates the terms, Party B can take Party A to court for not complying with the agreement. A smart contract fortifies such agreements in code so the rules are automatically enforced without courts (or any third party) getting involved.”</span></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><span>“These smart contracts establish the DAO’s rules. Those with a stake in a DAO then get voting rights and may influence how the organization operates by deciding on or creating new governance proposals. This model prevents DAOs from being spammed with proposals: A proposal will only pass once the majority of stakeholders approve it. How that majority is determined varies from DAO to DAO and is specified in the smart contracts. DAOs are fully autonomous and transparent. As they are built on open-source blockchains, anyone can view their code. Anyone can also audit their built-in treasuries, as the blockchain records all financial transactions.”"</span></p>
